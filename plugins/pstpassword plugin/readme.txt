Versions History
================


* Version 1.20:
  o Fixed to automatically detect the correct location of PST files
    on Outlook 2013/2016 ( C:\Users\[User Profile]\Documents\Outlook
    Files ).

* Version 1.17:
  o Removed the command-line options that export the passwords to a
    file from the official version. A version of this tool with full

* Version 1.16:
  o Added 'Copy First Password' option (Ctrl+P).

* Version 1.15:

    this option is turned on, the column names are added as the first
    line when you export to csv or tab-delimited file.
  o You can now send the pst passwords list to stdout by specifying
    an empty filename ("") in the command-line of all save parameters.
    For example: PstPassword.exe /stab "" >> c:\temp\passwords.txt

* Version 1.12:
  o Added /pstfiles command-line option.

    to another application and then returned back to PstPassword.

* Version 1.02 - The configuration is now saved to a file instead of
  the Registry.
* Version 1.01 - New option: Get More Passwords - Displays 100
  additional passwords for the selected pst file.
* Version 1.00 - First release.



Password Encryption in PST File
===============================

The password encryption in the PST file is very weak, and for each
password-protected PST file, there are many passwords that can open it.
PstPassword provides 3 different passwords for each password-protected
PST file. It's possible that one of them will be the origianl password
that you typed, and it's also possible that none of these passwords will
be identical to the original one. However, all 3 passwords provided by
PstPassword will open the PST file without problems.

Using PstPassword
=================

PstPassword doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, just run the executable file,
PstPassword.exe
After you run PstPassword, the main window displays the list of all PST
files of the current logged on user (Under Documents and Settings\User
Name\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook). For each
password-protected PST file, PstPassword provide 3 alternative passwords
that will open the PST file. If the PST is not protected by a password,
the 3 password columns remain empty, and the CRC value column is
0x00000000.
If you want to recover a password of PST file that doesn't appear in the
default list, you can press F7 and select the desired PST file, or simply
drag the PST file from Explorer window into the main window of
PstPassword.
If from some reason PstPassword fails to read a PST file, an error
message is displayed under the error column, and the item is painted with
pink color.

In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run PstPassword with /savelangfile parameter:
   PstPassword.exe /savelangfile
   A file named PstPassword_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   PstPassword utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.

   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run PstPassword, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.

   the language file, or move it to another folder.
